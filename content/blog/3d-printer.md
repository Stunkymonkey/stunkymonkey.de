In 2018 I bought an "ANET A8" 3D printer. I was very happy in building it myself with the help of a friend. The results were ok, but not perfect.
Therefore I decided to print additional upgrades and improve the 3D printer.

# Buy recommendations:

Both are Must-have improvements.

- [Glas panel](https://www.amazon.de/VS-Electronic-840569-Glaspanel-3D-Drucker/dp/B00ICKHRBA): the original bed is too sticky. With this one, the printed models get loose by simply cooling down.
- [Mosfet for print bed](https://www.amazon.de/Hrph-3D-Drucker-beheiztes-Bett-Leistungsmodul-MOSFET-Upgrade/dp/B06ZYQN6VQ): There are multiple [reports](https://all3dp.com/2/anet-a8-mosfet-upgrade-does-it-help-and-how-to-do-it/) that the motherboard is not designed carefully. I experienced as well, that the connection at the motherboard started to get brown. Therefore I highly recommend this to reduce fire risk.


# Printed recommendations:

This list is longer, so I categorized them into four groups:

## Must-have

- [X-belt tensioner](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1683070): improve precision greatly
- [Y-belt tensioner](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2024293): improve precision
- [Brackets to reduce X-Axis Motion](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1872162): reduce X-Axis wiggle
- [Extruder Cooling Duct](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2121279): way better cooling.
- [Spool Holder / Adapter (51/52 mm diameter)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1888486): without it, the spool rotates very irregular and can cause the filament to leap into the hot nozzle.

## Recommend

- [Wing Nut bed level screw knob](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2000216): When levelling this is much more comfortable.
- [X-axis belt holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1666094): If the belt gets tensioned very hard this makes sure it stays this way.
- [Y-axis belt holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1648888): Same as above
- [Filament Guide & Filter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2117824): simply remove the dust from the filament to have a better print quality.
- [Front Frame Brace](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1857991): slightly improves the tension of the Y-belt.
- [Rear Frame Brace](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1852358): makes the whole frame stiffer
- [Extruder Arm / Filament Release / Extruder Button](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2269032): when inserting a new filament, this is much more comfortable.
- [Mosfet Mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2018906): having a separate Mosfet for the bed is a must-have. This keeps the setup clean.

## Nice-to-have

- Tool holder [(left)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2072360), [(right)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2086689): keeps the build clean.
- [Power supply cover](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2332811): I was not a big fan of the direct cable at the power supply. Therefore I bought an adapter for the cold appliance plug.
- [Filament Clip](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:42528): I a filament is not used it tends to unroll itself. This keeps it in place.
- [X-Axis Cable Chain with Z Stop Adjustment](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2104821): prevents the cables from cluttering.
- [Extruder Fan Spacer](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1798669): helps when assembling the heater or cleaning the nozzle.
- [Raspberry Pi Mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2479264): to have a tidy setup. 
- [Raspberry PI B Mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2032678): but the "Raspberry PI B" itself is too slow for good usage
- [Filament guide (Horizontal)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1764285): helps to prevent the filament from breaking
- [M8 Nut Cap](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2357524): just better looking

## Not recommend

- [Button guide](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1430125): no idea why, but does not fit.
- [Bed Level Thumbwheel Upgrade](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2350276): only use the spring centering part. There are better thumbwheels above.
