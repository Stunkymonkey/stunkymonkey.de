Title: About Me
Draft: false

I'm stunkymonkey. A guy from Stuttgart, Germany.

In my free time I like to work outside and help a friend in his vineyard. Additionally I like to bake my own bread with sourdough and program in several opensource projects.

My main contributions are done in [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/).
